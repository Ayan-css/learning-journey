## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (with Hooks: `useState`, `useCallback`, `useRef`, `useEffect`)
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- `passwordGenerator()` creates a new password every time options change.
- `ToClipboardcopyPassword()` copies the password to the clipboard using a `ref`.
- `useEffect()` watches changes in options and triggers password generation.
